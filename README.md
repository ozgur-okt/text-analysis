# About the repository


This repository includes the codes I used through my master thesis which is about detection of aggression by text analysis method. Process started with cleaning of the texts that were written by 203 participants and analysis of data in correlation with other surveys. I did analysis by using LIWC and Empath dictionaries.

I also used one aggression scale to see if there is a correlation between aggression level and number of aggression-related words in text.

During the study my main source abouth text analysis methods was:
